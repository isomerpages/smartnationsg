# Health

By 2030, the number of elderly citizens is expected to reach 900,000. With an ageing population and declining old-age support ratio due to our low birth rates, healthcare must be made more proactive. Our health initiatives are focused on guiding citizens to take pre-emptive steps to keep themselves healthy and provide them with assistance to manage their well-being better.
