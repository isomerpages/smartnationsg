# A Digital First Singapore

Technological disruption is happening on a global scale. 

As a globally connected nation, we need to ensure that Singapore can compete at this global level to ensure that we are not left behind. The Smart Nation initiative is the next phase of our nation-building – to build on our strengths and advantages as a small and agile country.

At the broadest level, the economy is the most significant domain driving Singapore's growth and competitiveness. It is supported by the Government, leading the charge forward to catalyse change and innovation across all fields, including the public sector. These efforts are underpinned by measures to ensure that all segments of society can harness digital technologies and benefit from them. The enhancements in digital technologies are transforming the way we live, work and play.

>We envision a future Singapore that is a leading economy powered by digital innovation, and a world-class city with a Government that gives our citizens the best home possible and responds to their different and changing needs.

## Enabling A Culture Of Innovation & Experimentation

We encourage both the public and private sectors to experiment and explore to discover breakthroughs in technologies – which is essential for Singapore's innovation and growth. 

Various platforms will be supporting the Smart Nation Initiative, and some of them are listed below:

### Open Data
Data is the lifeblood of technological developments and having public data sets that anyone could use is very important. Data sets that public agencies have collected have been made available and accessible to the public through online portals. Therefore, anyone can participate and co-create citizen-centric solution using the data. 

Access the open data sets [available here](/media-hub/open-data-resources/)

### Living Laboratory

Singapore remains committed to investing in research and innovation to catalyse emerging breakthroughs and drive new areas of economic growth. These initiatives include the <a href="https://www.nrf.gov.sg/about-nrf/rie-ecosystem" target="_blank">Research, Innovation and Enterprise</a> and <a href="https://www.aisingapore.org/" target="_blank">AI Singapore</a>. 
  
We are an ideal location for companies and researchers to develop, prototype and pilot their technological solutions.

### Industry and Start-up Ecosystem

Start-up accelerators such as <a href="https://www.jtc.gov.sg/industrial-land-and-space/Pages/jtc-launchpad.aspx" target="_blank">JTC Launchpad</a>, a strong presence of venture capitalist and MNCs, and the formation of <a href="https://www.sginnovate.com/" target="_blank">SGInnovate</a>, have been developed to support Singapore's start-up ecosystem. 

Connecting technopreneurs with industry mentors, and being the bridge between innovation and enterprise gives Singapore the edge to encourage people to reach for the sky and dream up new ideas. This also gives the entrepreneurs a much-needed boost to get them started on their journey as well.

The Punggol Digital District **(pending link to PDD page on SNW)** is a prime example of an environment that we are developing to attract the best tech companies and talents, and foster their growth. Through clustering of the growth sector, we aim to bring together high-value digital services in PDD and create an ecosystem with conducive test-bed environments that enable our businesses and the community to thrive in a digital economy.
 
### Cybersecurity and Data Privacy

Cybersecurity is another key enabler of our Smart Nation. We recognise the possible risks and prioritise data privacy and safeguarding of critical systems and networks, even as we make them smart.

We have a robust system to continually monitor and address security concerns through our Personal Data Protection Laws and cybersecurity strategies.

### Computational Capabilities and Digital Inclusion

Our Smart Nation efforts are underscored by re-skilling and promoting coding and computational thinking skills, ensuring that all segments of the population benefit, regardless of age or digital literacy. Resources are also in place to assist companies and SMEs seeking new opportunities in the digital economy.

### Cross-border Collaboration

![ASEAN Smart Cities Network](/images/our-smart-nation/ASEAN-Smart-Cities-Network.jpg)

Cities need to come together to share good ideas and best practices, explore collaborations, and test-bed people-centric smart solutions. Singapore remains open to sharing new ideas and learning from others. This will allow us to adopt ideas and best practices that can benefit Singapore and the region.

In 2018, the <a href="https://asean.org/asean/asean-smart-cities-network/" target="_blank">ASEAN Smart Cities Network</a> was established as part of Singapore's ASEAN chairmanship. It is a collaborative platform where member cities exchange best practice and urban solutions and catalyse bankable smart city projects. The ASCN seeks to harness the opportunities presented by rapid urbanisation, while building resilience against its increasingly complex strategic challenges, like cyber-threats and trade friction. The goal is to improve the lives of people in this region, using technology as an enabler.
