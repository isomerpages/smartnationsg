# The Next Key Frontier Of Singapore's Smart Nation Journey

The National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy is a key step in our Smart Nation journey. It spells out our plans to deepen our use of AI technologies to transform our economy. We want to go beyond just adopting technology.  The aim is to fundamentally rethink business models and make changes to reap productivity gains and create new growth areas.

We have currently identified five National AI Projects in these key areas:
-	**Transport and logistics:** Intelligent Freight Planning to optimise the movement of freight to improve productivity for businesses and traffic efficiency.
-	**Smart Cities and Estates:** Seamless and Efficient Municipal Services to make municipal services more responsive, reliable and timely.
-	**Healthcare:** Chronic Disease Prediction and Management to help prevent and better manage chronic diseases.
-	**Education:** Personalised Education through Adaptive Learning and Assessment to help teachers better customise and improve every student's learning experience.
-	**Safety and Security:** Border Clearance Operations – to strengthen border security while improving traveller experience.

In these projects, AI technologies will address challenges and deliver a strong social and economic impact for Singapore and Singaporeans. 

The National AI strategy also outlines five key enablers to anchor a vibrant and sustainable AI ecosystem to drive AI innovation and adoption across the economy. They are:
1)	Triple Helix Partnership: Research Community + Industry + Government
2)	AI Talent and Education
3)	Data Architecture 
4)	Progressive and Trusted Environment
5)	International Collaboration

## Working Together

The National AI Strategy needs everyone to come together - Singaporeans, businesses, researchers and the Government – to work closely to achieve our goals. Singapore will also need to work with international partners to advance the deployment of AI in Singapore. There are four ways you can be involved in the National AI Strategy:
