TeleHealth provides integrated and seamless care to effectively meet our healthcare needs remotely via digital and telecommunications technologies. It optimises resources to overcome workforce constraints in the healthcare sector. Some of the benefits of this platform are: 

-	Therapists will be able to offer care to a larger group of patients concurrently; productivity levels are improved. 
-	Improve access to rehabilitation services to achieve higher patient compliance towards a better functional recovery.
-	Deliver quality healthcare to an ageing population, enabling our elderly to age-in-place.
-	Reduce the need for patients and their caregivers to travel and wait for appointments in hospitals.

## Smart Health Video Consultation (VC) for Healthcare

- Launched in April 2017, VC leverages video conferencing technology to allow patients to consult their care team remotely.
- The system offers a level of immediacy when patients need care, and in-person visits are not possible.
- The platform will be used in areas such as follow-up services for paediatric eczema pharmacy consultation, paediatric home care services, lactation consultation, and speech therapy for KKH patients; post-stroke, infectious disease, cancer patient care, and more at other institutions.

## Smart Health TeleRehab

-	Allows patients to undergo their rehabilitation exercises at a time and location of their choice by using wearable sensors and remote monitoring by a therapist.
-	The data is transmitted to therapists wirelessly through wearable motion sensors attached to patientsâ€™ limbs. Clinicians can remotely conduct rehabilitation and therapy sessions for patients from the comfort of their homes. 
-	Support from healthcare professionals for patients and caregivers can also be done remotely via an Internet-based video conferencing service that works on consumer devices and can support one-to-one and multi-user interactions.
-	This solution is suitable for patients recovering from conditions including stroke, fractures, lower limb joint replacements or amputations, deconditioning and musculoskeletal conditions.
