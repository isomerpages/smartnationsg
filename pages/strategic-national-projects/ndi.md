As more services head online, it is essential to have a secure and convenient system that will benefit everyone when transacting online. 

With the National Digital Identity (NDI) eco-system, we have created a digital infrastructure that both public and private sectors can use, streamlining their operations while providing a more seamless experience for users to provide their details â€“ in a secure environment.

## What is National Digital Identity?

It is a digital identity system for Singapore residents and businesses to conveniently and securely transact digitally with the Government and private sectors. It has been operational since 2020. 

NDI is made out of the following key sections:  

### Singpass (Singapore Personal Access)

- An authentication system launched in 2003 for citizens to access hundreds of digital Government services.
- 2-step Verification (2FA) for digital transactions involving sensitive information, such as filing taxes and viewing CPF statements.

### Singpass Mobile

- The mobile application that allows users to log in to Singpass with their fingerprint, facial recognition or a 6-digit passcode.
- Alternative 2-step Verification (2FA) mode for a more convenient and secure log in to Government digital services.
- Users no longer need to enter their passwords.
- Singaporeans who are overseas will not have to use a physical token or wait to receive a text message before they can log in to Singpass, making it more convenient and efficient to transact from wherever they are.

### MyInfo

- A "Tell Us Once" service that allows Singpass users to auto-fill selected personal details for online forms.
- Reduces repetitive form-filling and the need for users to provide verifying documents.
- Enhances accuracy and speeds up processes in both the Government and private sector.
- Over 110 government services and 90 private sector services currently use MyInfo. Some examples from the private sector include:
  - Cross-border digital mobile remittance with M1 Remit
  - Credit card applications at multiple banks
  - Online applications for savings and current accounts, car loans and credit cards at various banks 
  - Property transactions with StreetSine
  - Purchase of life insurance with Aviva
 
### NDI Developer and Partner Portal

- Allows developers and businesses to use MyInfo for their digital services
- Offers a sandbox environment for them to prototype digital innovations and build solutions faster.
