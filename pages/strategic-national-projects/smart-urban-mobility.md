Our transportation infrastructure is essential to our daily lives.

With our land scarcity, we are always working towards making our transportation system more efficient to ensure that our public transport system can handle our growing population. 

## What is Smart Urban Mobility?

We use digital technologies to find solutions to enhance our public transport system – in terms of comfort, convenience and reliability, and support our vision of a car-lite Singapore. 
 
## What can we expect?

### An improved commuting experience 
By analysing anonymised data obtained from commuters' fare cards and identifying commuter hotspots to manage bus fleets, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) can improve your commuting experience.

The data allows LTA and the bus operators to have actionable information on which bus routes are more popular. This would enable them to plan accordingly to address the public's everchanging needs – making the bus system more efficient. 

### Hands-free ticketing technology 

Trials are ongoing to look at offering a more inclusive public transport system. 

The hands-free fare gates will allow elderly, families with young children, and commuters with mobility challenges to enter and exit train stations and buses quickly, without the need to tap their fare cards on the card readers.  

### Autonomous shuttles

Several trials are ongoing to gain insights on how technology can be deployed to strengthen intra-town connectivity and enhance mobility for commuters, particularly the elderly and persons with disabilities.

The trials are also to assess the feasibility of autonomous vehicles and how they will help with the long-term issue of workforce challenges – from peak hours or late night services.
