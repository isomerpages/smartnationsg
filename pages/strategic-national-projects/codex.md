## What is CODEX?

Core Operations Development Environment and eXchange (CODEX) is the digital platform that enables the Government to deliver better digital services to citizens faster and more cost efficiently.

It comprises the following:
-	A Government Data Architecture for common data standards and formats that enables seamless data sharing between agencies;
- A systematic shift of less sensitive Government systems and data onto the commercial cloud, enabling the use of leading-edge private sector capabilities to develop digital services;
- A Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS) comprising a suite of shared software components and infrastructure to enable more efficient and focused building of digital applications.
 
## Benefits of CODEX
- Re-usable digital components, including machine readable data flows, middleware and micro-services, will be shared across agencies so that developers can plug and play into these resources and focus their time and energy on building products to serve the public better.
- The adoption of common tools and standards, within Government and by vendors, will reduce bugs and raise the quality, reliability and security of services.
- Government can tap into what the commercial cloud can offer in scalability and reliability, as well as software services and tools.
- This facilitates public and the private sectors to work together to develop more user-centric services for the public.
