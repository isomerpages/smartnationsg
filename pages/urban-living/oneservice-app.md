# One Service. One App

We all play a part to keep our estate a pleasant place to live in. 

The OneService App provides a simple and fuss-free platform to report any situations around the estate – regardless of which agency will be responsible for rectifying issue. Saving you the hassle and time of trying to find out who you need to call. There is even a case map – so you can check if someone else has already reported the same situation. 

Once the issue has been reported via the App, it will alert the correct agency to quickly address the issue at hand. The relevant agency will update the status of the cases reported on the App as they are working on it and when it has solved.
