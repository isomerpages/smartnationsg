-  PUB is working towards using Smart Water Meters, progressively across the island, to make daily water usage data accessible for consumers from tap to app.
- Smart Water Meters are designed to monitor and collect water consumption data. 
  - This will allow PUB to provide consumers with value-added services through a mobile app - such as understanding their water usage and alerting households of suspected water leaks.
- The AMR trial was conducted in 2016 to some 500 households in Punggol.
  - The trial consists of an AMR-enabled water meter that registers and transmits readings wirelessly to PUB and a mobile app for residents to use.
  - Through the mobile app, residents can track their detailed water consumption and receive leak and high usage notifications.
  - Using a gamification and reward platform, the residents are also encouraged to reduce their water consumption.

PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, is rolling out the Smart Water Meter Programme's first phase in Singapore. 

The first phase will have 300,000 smart water meters installed in new and existing residential, commercial and industrial premises by 2023. With this, customers can look forward to tracking their water use daily, be empowered to be more water-efficient, detect leaks early to reduce water loss and save money!
