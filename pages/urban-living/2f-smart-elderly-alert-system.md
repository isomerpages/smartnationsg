# Improving The Lives Of Our Silver Generation

![Smart elderly alert system](/images/initiatives/smart-elderly-alert-system.jpg)

We all know that Singapore has an ageing population. We need to start planning now to ensure that our infrastructure will support our residents in their golden years. 

As of the end of 2020, there are over 600,000 residents over 65 years on our little island. While some of them might live with their families, others might live by themselves for various reasons – such as wanting to maintain their independence or unable to live with their families.

## What is the Smart Elderly Alert System?

HDB has run some trials in 2015 and 2016 for the Smart Elderly Alert System. It explored the ease of use for the elderly with the smart devices installed in their homes. The system consists of motion and door contact sensors in the person’s home to learn the habits of the elderly and is connected to a caregiver to receive alerts when there are irregular movements, such as an unusually long period of inactivity. 

There is a personal alert button that the person can keep on their person to alert their nominated caregiver in an emergency. The Alert System allows the elderly to have their independence yet be able to reach out to someone should the need arises – improving their day to day lives. 

Even if the elderly person is living with their adult children as their caregiver – this helps bridge the gap when no one is home during working hours. If there is a medical emergency, the automatic notifications will alert the caregiver, who can quickly check on the person and seek medical help if necessary as promptly as possible. 


## What are the benefits of the Smart Elderly Alert System? 
- Non-intrusive, non-contact and low-cost methodology and provides timely alerts.
- Allows the elderly to live independently and offers peace of mind to family members and caregivers.
- Provides a solution to reach someone in an emergency, such as a fall, via a personal button
