Formerly known as Moments of Life, it was rebranded to LifeSG in August 2020. The LifeSG mobile app that gives citizens access to government services and information in one convenient platform. 

Since the app's launch in June 2018, the app has provided services aimed at families with young children and seniors aged 60 and above. Features such as an Active Ageing module was rolled out in September 2019 and an Employment Support Guide for job-seekers was rolled out in June 2020.

The rebranding of Moments of Life to LifeSG also included enhancing it to provide users with more than 40 services from various Government agencies, with more services to come! LifeSG also comes with a personal dashboard where citizens can access guides which simplify processes and discover recommended content based on their activities in the app.
