# Secured, Verified And Tamper-Resistant Credentials 

![Open Certs](/images/our-smart-nation/Initiatives/OpenCerts.png)

OpenCerts is a blockchain-based[^1] platform developed by the Government Technology Agency, Ministry of Education, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and SkillsFuture Singapore. The platform offers an easy and reliable way to issue and validate academic certificates that are tamper-resistant.
[^1]: Blockchain is a tool for digitally recording transactions, be it between a buyer and seller, or in this case, an educational institution and its graduates. A public blockchain is neither owned nor maintained by an individual and instead decentralised. This ensures that records made on it cannot be altered or destroyed by a single person.

## How Does OpenCerts Work?

When an OpenCerts certificate is issued, a unique code is published onto the blockchain. A cryptographic proof[^2] is appended onto the certificate data and sent to the individual recipient. During verification, the certificate data is checked against its proof for signs of tampering and against the code on the blockchain for validity.
[^2]: A cryptographic proof is a method by which one party can prove to another party that they know a value of the proof without being aware of any other details within the documentation.

Educational institutions can easily create digital versions of every academic certificate that has been issued and publish them on a public ledger.

With OpenCerts, education institutions benefit from the cost savings of verifying issued certificates automatically. Students receive their academic certificates and transcripts as a digital file that can be easily viewed, shared and verified internationally.
