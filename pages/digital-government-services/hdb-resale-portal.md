# Halving The Timeline

Buying or selling a resale flat previously required both parties to complete a series of paperwork and administrative matters – which to some, seemed never-ending. And you would need two different appointments with HDB, the first to submit and verify all your documents and the second is the resale completion appointment. To streamline the purchase and selling process, HDB has developed the HDB Resale Portal!

## Time Saved with the Portal 
- As all forms and checks are completed via the online portal, flat buyers and sellers only need to attend one resale completion appointment, either at HDB Hub or at their solicitor’s office, to sign the necessary documents.
- With this portal, the entire transaction can be shortened by up to 8 weeks, from the previous estimate of 16 weeks.
