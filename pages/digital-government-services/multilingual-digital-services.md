The Government is developing a multilingual digital services policy in line with efforts to promote inclusion and access to digital government services.

To better understand users' requirements, we started with a selection of digital services with a high transactional volume and are commonly used across demographics. 

The following digital services have been updated to include Singapore's four vernacular languages:

- Accessing Central Provident Fund balances
- Applying for the Housing & Development Board’s EASE (Enhancement for Active Seniors) grant
- Online booking for medical appointments at the National Healthcare Group’s Polyclinics
