IMDA, PricewaterhouseCoopers and a Singapore-based startup, DEX, entered into the first Data Collaborative Pilot in April 2018. The six-month pilot  programme had the aim to: 
-	Build a decentralised platform that provides access to data in a regulated and audited fashion, with full awareness and consent of data owners;
-	Drive data sharing collaborative.

Today, the <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/Data-Innovation" target="_blank">Data Innovation Programme Office (DIPO)</a> sits under the IMDA umbrella to promote the responsible use of data. 

DIPO works with industry partners to scope problem statements through industry-led Data Collaboratives and drive innovation and development for Singaporeâ€™s digital economy. They help provide the data ecosystem with more flexibility to work with data and share data in exchange for compliance with ex ante standards and transparency and maintain an open ecosystem that allows the dataset to grow.
