The Network Trade Platform (NTP) is a Government-owned, one-stop trade platform that connects industry players â€“ in Singapore and abroad! NTP is a one-stop trade information management platform to support companies in the trade and logistics industry and adjacent sectors such as trade finance.

It is developed on open architecture where third-party solution providers or IT developers can leverage the toolkits provided. They can also use NTP to create new services and applications based on market needs. It aims to be the open innovation platform allowing the development of insights and new services with cross-industry data.

NTP also functions as the document hub for digitisation at the source to reuse data to cut costs and streamline processes.
