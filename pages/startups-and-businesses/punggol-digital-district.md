The Punggol Digital District (PDD) will be the first district in Singapore to adopt a one integrated masterplan approach that brings together a business park, a university and community facilities. Located in the north of Punggol, the development spans 50 hectares and will house Singapore Institute of Technology’s (SIT) new campus and JTC’s business park buildings and as part of the District. 

## Benefits of the Innovation Ecosystem
- With the SIT campus and JTC business park buildings situated together, it will help facilitate greater industry academia collaboration, through the cross-fertilisation of ideas and knowledge among students and industry professionals.
  - New technological or business ideas conceived in SIT could be prototyped, tested and adopted by businesses in PDD, contributing to a higher rate of commercialisation success.
-	PDD will also house key growth sectors of the digital economy such as cybersecurity and Internet of Things, and is expected to bring approximately 28,000 exciting jobs closer to residents in Punggol and the north-east region.
-	By clustering of these growth sectors, the district will be an ecosystem of open innovation and a conducive test-bed environment that will enable businesses and the community to thrive in our growing digital economy. 
-	In addition to bringing more exciting job and learning opportunities closer to home, the District is also planned to include green links to the waterfront and also more public spaces for the community to relax and unwind.
