In line with our Smart Nation objectives and the Government’s aim to create a secure platform for businesses to transact with government digital services. Corppass is the corporate digital identity for businesses and other entities (such as non-profit organisations and associations) to access e-services provided by government agencies since September 2018

## Why Should Businesses Use Corppass?

- Corppass enhances cyber hygiene by allowing employees to use Corppass, instead of Singpass, to transact on their company’s behalf.
- Business owners are also allowed greater control, with the flexibility of granting employees separate roles to access government digital services.
- Provides companies greater convenience and visibility by providing a single platform to grant and manage the authorisations given to their employees across all government digital services.
- For foreign registered entities and individuals without Singpass, Corppass will also allow you to transact with selected government agencies in Singapore.
