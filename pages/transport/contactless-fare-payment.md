With the technology such as NFC becoming a big part of our daily lives, more Singaporeans are relying our mobile devices, gadgets and credit/debit cards for our daily transactions. 

Land Transport Authority (LTA) is leveraging on this technologies to focus on commuter-centric e-payments for public transport, making fare payments more convenient for commuters.

## Hands-free ticketing technology trials

LTA, SMRT and ST Engineering are running a trial at Redhill, Tiong Bahru, Kembangan and Bedok MRT stations, to provide for a more inclusive public transport system.

The hands-free automation fare collection system replaces existing card payment methods, and uses long-range Radio Frequency Identification (RFI) technology to detect a commuter's fare card and deduct fares automatically as they pass a sensor. The hands-free fare gates allow people with disabilities or families with young children to enter and exit train stations easily, without the need to tap their fare cards at the gates.

Trials are also underway for a Bluetooth-enabled alternative fare collection system that allows commuters to connect seamlessly with gates using a mobile device.
