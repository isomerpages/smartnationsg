# Take A Drive Into the Future

Can you imagine a day when the family car takes your children to school, then returns to the car park just as you are leaving for work? You hop in and drive yourself to your office, where you park the car in your office building. At 10 am, your elderly parents call you and ask if they can borrow the car to go and have lunch to catch up with their friends. All you need to do is to send the car home, so they can be driven to their lunch appointment and home – while you are at the office. 

This could all be possible in the near future thanks to driverless vehicles!

Self-driving technology has the potential to transform our transport system and improve our living environment. We are currently exploring the application of self-driving technology to public transport to bring in new forms of shared mobility and address the constraints we face in land and manpower. 

Driverless vehicles can be deployed for the disabled or elderly to afford them more mobility and independence. They would not need to wait for a family member or caregiver to be available to drive them where they need to go. 

In the commercial section, the same technology also holds great potential for the freight transportation and utility services sectors to address staffing challenges and ease traffic congestion during peak hours by deploying autonomous systems at night.

## Autonomous Vehicles (AV) Trials in Singapore

Several AV trials are running concurrently to expedite the development and testing of AV vehicles.  

LTA is also working with companies to develop autonomous truck platooning solutions to transport containers from one port terminal to another. They are exploring options for self-driving utility vehicles for waste collection and road sweeping to address the manpower issues we continuously face.

You can check out some public trials to experience what it might be like in the near future. 
 
### A* STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R)

-	A* STAR's self-driving vehicle was the first to be approved for public road testing at one-north in July 2015.
-	It has ferried several dignitaries such as our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Minister S. Iswaran, Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, and several Ministers from other countries.

### National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)

-	Their working research prototypes have been demonstrated around the NUS campus. Rides are requested via a smartphone by selecting desired pick-up and drop-off locations.
-	The team also conducted the first-ever local public trials of self-driving vehicles at the Chinese and Japanese Gardens in October 2014.
-	The team has since retrofitted an electric passenger car and was the second vehicle to be approved for more complex testing on Singapore's public roads. The team has started testing at one-north since September 2015.

### nuTonomy, an MIT / SMART spin-off

- nuTonomy's focus is on launching a commercial autonomous mobility-on-demand service in Singapore, and their software has been tested in the US, Singapore, and Europe.
- nuTonomy was the first private company - and the third applicant - to obtain approval for public road testing at one-north as of April 2016.

### Gardens by the Bay, in collaboration with ST Engineering

- Auto Rider is the first fully-operational SDV in Asia, aimed at enhancing connectivity within the Gardens and providing visitors with an alternative, revolutionary mode of getting around.
- Fully electric-powered and air-conditioned, each vehicle has a capacity of 10 people.

### Nanyang Technological University (NTU)

- The driverless shuttle bus travels a 500m route connecting student halls with the main academic areas, ferrying up to 300 passengers a day.
- The vehicle will eventually travel across the entire campus and is expected to connect NTU to the neighbouring Cleantech Park.

### LTA and ST Kinetics

- ST Kinetics has launched an autonomous vehicle (AV) on Sentosa to ply along the island's popular destinations, including the Beach Station, Palawan Beach and Siloso Point. 
- Their autonomous buses will be tested in various locations, scenarios, and environments, such as heavy rain conditions, to ensure the passengers' safety under all circumstances.

### MOT and PSA collaboration with Scania and Toyota

-	The collaboration will involve developing technologies to enable heavy vehicles to move in leader-follower formation and fully automate the processes for precise docking and undocking of cargo.
- Phase 1 trials will be conducted in the companies' respective research centres, following which MOT and PSA Corporation will select one company for the phase 2 trial. A 10-km long test route along West Coast Highway has been designated for the phase 2 trials.
 
### Katoen Natie and VDL

-	Driverless trucks have gone on trial on Jurong Island since September 2017.
- The trucks will be retrofitted with autonomous systems which will communicate with transponders installed in the road. 
- The trucks will ply a fixed 6km to 8km route as part of the initial phase and guided by satellite in the next phase. The aim is to have the trucks eventually ply public roads!
