# Enhancing Public Transport Through Data 

![SG Traffic Watch screenshot](/images/our-smart-nation/Initiatives/SG-Traffic-watch.jpeg) 

Land Transport Authority (LTA) has been gathering data from the sensors installed on buses and anonymised data obtained from commuters' fare cards to help make our public transport system more efficient and convenient for everyone. 

The bus sensors provide data on the arrival times of buses and the buses' real-time location data. These data collected helps to facilitate transport planning to better meet commuters' demands. While the anonymised data from the fare cards can help identify commuter hotspots to manage bus fleets, thereby improving the commuting experience. 

The insights gained from the data are crucial in helping LTA better anticipate and address the needs of different commuters through improved policy planning.

## The Result from the Data Insights

-	There is a 92% reduction in the number of bus services with crowding issues despite a year-on-year increase in average daily bus ridership.
-	Average waiting time on popular services has been shortened by about 3 to 7 minutes!
 
## Real-Time Singapore Traffic Watch

To see how data can provide insights to help manage Singapore's traffic to serve citizens better, visit <a href="https://sgtrafficwatch.org" target="_blank">https://sgtrafficwatch.org.</a> 

With their real-time map of Singapore's roads, you can explore how the different data sources are linked to explain congestions and other traffic outliers and in understanding historical trends. SG Traffic Watch also pulls data from LTA's Land Transport DataMall and NEA weather service, providing analytical charts which plot current traffic conditions against past trends.

## Why is Open Data Important?

-	With open transport data, the public and third-party developers can tap on these data sources to create people-centric transport solutions
-	The current transport data sets that have been made publicly accessible via LTA's Land Transport DataMall include:
  - Real-time data on bus arrival timings
  - Taxi availability
  - Traffic conditions
  - Carpark availability 
-	Downloads of transport data from the Land Transport DataMall have increased from an average of 4 million to 600 million per month since April 2015. Several third party transport apps have been developed tapping on this source of data, such as the <a href="https://www.busuncle.sg/" target="_blank">Bus Uncle chatbot</a>, which is grumpy yet friendly and helpful. The kicker? He speaks Singlish fluently!

## More than just Collecting data 

- The Fusion AnalyticS for public Transport Emergency Response (FASTER) system analyses data collected from various sources to: 
  - Help authorities and public transport operators visualise commuting patterns to improve transport planning
  - Triggering early alerts of crowd surges for operations to be prepared accordingly
  - Predict the impact of incidents – such as the extent of delay, the number of commuters affected – and to recommend measures, such as the injection of additional trains and buses to respond to the incident quickly 
-A next-generation Electronic Road Pricing System is in the works to help develop a more accurate picture of the real-time traffic situation. The system will collect comprehensive, real-time, aggregated traffic data. The system will enable LTA to intervene where necessary, such as adjusting traffic light timings and providing traffic light priority for buses.

As technology changes and improves, LTA will continually explore more ways to leverage data analytics to improve public land transport services quality.
