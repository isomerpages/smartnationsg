# Understanding Public Transport On-Demand Needs

Imagine booking a self-driving shuttle with a tap of your smartphone that can bring you from your doorstep right to the train station, or being able to suggest and book bus routes through an app and simply hop on to get to your destination. 

A real-time demand-driven intelligent transport system that optimises land use and reduces reliance on limited manpower will offer commuters more options and accessibility for first-and-last-mile connectivity. It will also bring greater mobility to the elderly and other commuters who may have difficulties taking present-day public transport.

## On-Demand Shuttle Trials Conducted  

### Autonomous shuttles on Sentosa 

-	In June 2018, MOT and ST Engineering started on-road testing of autonomous shuttles along a 1km road at Tanjong Beach, Sentosa. In 2019, it was extended to cover a 5km route. With this on-demand shuttle, visitors were able to use their smartphones to hail these autonomous shuttles. 
-	The insights gained from this trial has provided more data on how technology can be deployed to strengthen intra-town connectivity, and enhance mobility for commuters, particularly the elderly and persons with disabilities.

-	A 6-month on-demand public bus service (ODPB) operational trial commenced on 17 Dec 2018. The trial explores the utilisation of dynamic routing and matching algorithms to optimise limited resources.
-	The trial offered more seamless and convenient bus journeys for commuters during timings with low or unpredictable ridership.
-	Commuters could request pick-ups and drop-offs at any bus stop within the defined geo-fence area through a mobile app.
