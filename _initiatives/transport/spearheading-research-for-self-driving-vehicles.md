**What is CETRAN?**

-   The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and JTC, in partnership with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), launched  The Centre of Excellence for Testing & Research of AVs – NTU (CETRAN), and the Test Circuit, at CleanTech Park on 1 August 2016.

-   CETRAN will spearhead the development of testing requirements for SDVs, for which testing will be carried out at the 1.8-ha CETRAN Test Circuit, which is jointly developed by LTA and JTC to provide industry players with a simulated road environment for the testing SDVs prior to their deployment on public roads.
**Why begin research in standards?**

-   To enable Singapore to move closer to its goal of deploying self-driving vehicles (SDVs) for shared transport.
-   Given the lack of existing international standards for large-scale SDV deployment, CETRAN and the Test Circuit will place Singapore at the global forefront to develop such standards to safely integrate SDVs into our transport system!

**What can we expect?**

-   The CETRAN Test Circuit will strengthen Singapore’s attractiveness as a living lab for local and international parties to test, certify, trial and deploy SDVs here.

-   NTU will operate the CETRAN Test Circuit and evaluate the SDV prototypes to be tested in Singapore according to their ability to manoeuvre in local conditions such as:

-   traffic rules
-   traffic behaviour
-   road design
-   our tropical climate

-   CETRAN will also house an expert team formed by NTU that will perform testing in a computer-simulated environment representative of Singapore’s traffic conditions, to complement the tests performed in the test circuit.

-   The CETRAN Test Circuit will also be open to industry players for the development and testing of their own SDVs, as they work towards meeting the standards set by CETRAN.
