**Why on-demand autonomous shuttles?**

-   Imagine booking a self-driving shuttle with a tap of your smartphone that can bring you from your doorstep right to the train station; or being able to suggest and book bus routes through an app and thereafter simply hop on to get to your destination.

-   A real-time demand-driven intelligent transport system optimises the use of land and reduces reliance on limited manpower.

-   This also offers commuters a more comfortable option for first-and-last-mile connectivity, and brings greater mobility to the elderly and other commuters who may have difficulties in taking present-day public transport.
**What can we expect?**

-   Autonomous shuttles on Sentosa

-   In June 2018, MOT and ST Engineering commenced on-road testing of autonomous shuttles along a 1km road at Tanjong Beach, Sentosa. In 2019, a three-month trial will be conducted along a 5km route on the island.
-   Visitors will be able to use their smartphones to hail these shuttles. The insights gained from this trial will help better inform how technology can be deployed to strengthen intra-town connectivity, and enhance mobility for commuters, particularly the elderly and persons with disabilities.

-   On-demand public bus trial

-   The first part of a 6-month on-demand public bus service (ODPB) operational trial will commence on 17 Dec 2018. The trial explores the utilisation of dynamic routing and matching algorithms to optimise limited resources.
-   The trial will offer more seamless and convenient bus journeys for commuters, during timings with low or unpredictable ridership.
-   Commuters will be able to request for pick-ups and drop-offs at any bus stop within the defined geo-fence area through a mobile app.
