**Why contactless fare payment?**

-   With more Singaporeans relying on their mobile devices, tech gadgets and credit/debit cards to carry out everyday transactions, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is leveraging new technologies to shift towards commuter-centric e-payments for public transport, making fare payments more convenient for commuters.
-   More innovative fare payment systems for bus and train journeys means commuters can zip through fare gates by simply scanning their devices and potentially doing away with the hassle of topping up fare cards.

**What can we expect?**

-   Hands-free ticketing technology trial

-   The hands-free automation fare collection system replaces existing card payment methods, and uses long-range Radio Frequency Identification (RFI) technology to detect a commuter's fare card and deduct fares automatically as they pass a sensor
-   LTA and ST Engineering launched a trial at Redhill, Tiong Bahru, Kembangan and Bedok MRT stations in June 2018, to provide for a more inclusive public transport system.
-   The hands-free fare gates allow people with disabilities to enter and exit train stations easily, without the need to tap their fare cards at the gates.
-   A hands-free ticketing technology trial on buses will take place in late 2018.
-   Trials are also underway for a Bluetooth-enabled alternative fare collection system that allows commuters to connect seamlessly with gates using a mobile device.

-   Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) System

-   LTA and MasterCard jointly launched a pilot in March 2017 to allow commuters the ease of direct payment of public bus and train rides using contactless credit or debit cards.

-   More than 100,000 commuters signed up for the pilot, and an average of over 60,000 transactions were made daily.

-   In response to positive feedback, and to allow more commuters to enjoy the convenience of ABT, Visa and NETS came on board the pilot from June 2018.

-   With Singapore’s high mobile penetration rate, LTA also began trial for the use of mobile payment modes for public transport payments from the first quarter of 2018.

-   The pilot will allow LTA and its partners to fine-tune operations before offering ABT to all commuters on a permanent basis in future.

Following a successful pilot of the Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) system, the Land Transport Authority has launched SimplyGo, starting with Mastercard®, on 4 April 2019.

SimplyGo enables commuters to use contactless bank cards or mobile phones to pay for their travel on public transport, removing the need to carry a separate travel card or make upfront top-ups before travelling. Commuters simply need to tap their Mastercard contactless bank cards on the fare reader at the train station gantry or on the bus when boarding and alighting. Commuters can also easily view their travel expenditure and history by registering for an account on the TransitLink SimplyGo Portal, available online and via the TL SimplyGo mobile app.
