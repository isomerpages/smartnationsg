**How can public data help transport planning?**

-   By analysing anonymised data obtained from commuters' fare cards and identifying commuter hotspots to manage bus fleets, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) can help improve commuting experience.
-   Arrival times of buses are tracked using sensors installed in over 5,000 vehicles, and the real-time location data of buses helps facilitate transport planning to better meet commuters' demands.
-   Insights gained from data can help LTA better anticipate and address the needs of different types of commuters through improved policy planning.

  

**The result?**

-   A 92% reduction in the number of bus services with crowding issues despite year-on-year increase in average daily bus ridership
-   Average waiting time on popular services shortened by about 3 to 7 minutes!

**Real-Time Singapore Traffic Watch**

For an idea of how data and data analytics can provide insights to help in the management of Singapore's traffic to better serve citizens, visit  [https://sgtrafficwatch.org](https://sgtrafficwatch.org/)/. Explore how different data sources can be correlated to explain congestions and other traffic outliers in real-time, and in understanding historical trends. Using data from the LTA Land Transport DataMall and NEA weather service, analytical charts also plot current traffic conditions against past trends.

**How can open data help in the co-creation of solutions?**

-   With more open transport data, the public and third party developers can put them to good use in creating people-centric transport solutions.

-   Transport data sets that have been made publicly accessible via LTA's Land Transport DataMall include:

-   real-time data on bus arrival timings
-   taxi availability
-   traffic conditions
-   carpark availability

-   Downloads of transport data from the Land Transport DataMall have increased from an average of 4 million to 600 million per month since April 2015. A number of third party transport apps have been developed, including the  [Bus Uncle](https://www.busuncle.sg/)  chatbot. Check out the other apps  [here](https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall/app-zone.html).

**Whatâ€™s in the pipeline?**

-   The Fusion AnalyticS for public Transport Emergency Response (FASTER) system that will analyse data collected from various sources to:
    -   help authorities and operators visualise commuting patterns to improve transport planning
    -   predict the impact of incidents so as to better respond and recommend mitigating measures, such as the injection of additional trains and buses in times of emergencies
-   A next-generation Electronic Road Pricing System that will collect comprehensive, real-time, aggregated traffic data and in turn help develop a more accurate picture of real-time traffic situation. This will enable LTA to intervene where necessary, such as by adjusting traffic light timings and providing traffic light priority for buses.  

LTA will continue to explore more ways to leverage data analytics to improve the quality of public land transport services.
