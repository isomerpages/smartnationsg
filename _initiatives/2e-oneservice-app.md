We all play a part to keep our estate a pleasant place to live in. 

The OneService App provides a fuss-free and straightforward platform to report any situations around the estate. This saves you the hassle of finding out who you need to call to inform them of the situation. In addition, there is even a case map to check if someone else has already reported the same situation. 

Once the issue has been reported via the App, it will alert the respective agency to address the issue at hand quickly. The agency will update the status of the cases reported on the App as they are working on it and when it has solved. 

## Why download OneService? 
- It is a convenient way for members of the public to give their feedback on municipal issues without finding out which agency is responsible for the issue!
- The OneService mobile App adopts an issue-based approach where reported cases will be routed to relevant agencies more efficiently.
- Alerts users if they are near dengue clusters. Users who enable the dengue cluster alert on the App will be able to see the number of cases in the neighbourhood and the block of flats where these cases are located.
- You can even locate public car parks close to you or by the per hour parking rate via the OneService App. Also, you can easily pay for your parking via Parking.SG in the OneService App, making it extremely handy for drivers! 

## How OneService benefits you? 
- The App provides you with a single platform to report issues in your neighbourhood easily. 
- Municipal services are delivered more effectively.
- Interaction between residents and Government agencies on issues relating to them and their neighbourhood is enhanced, which helps improve the living environment for Singaporeans!
