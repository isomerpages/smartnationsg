Parents tend to have challenges keeping up with their child's school schedule, and it gets even more complicated when the children go to different schools, with two different programs, consent forms and updates! 

The app was developed to provide an efficient means of managing common administrative functions, making it more convenient for parents, and elevating teachers' administrative workload, allowing them to focus on teaching and nurturing.

## Benefits of Using Parents Gateway

- Enhanced convenience for parents:
  - Parents can perform administrative functions on the app, such as providing consent for their children to participate in school activities. The activities can be added quickly to the phone's calendar via the app for parents to be kept updated on the flurry of programmes and activities their children are involved in.
  - Parents with children attending different schools can use the app to access the information through one platform.
  - When a student moves from one level to another or from one school to another, their particulars will be updated automatically on the app, reducing hassle on the part of parents.
- Elevated administrative workload for teachers:
  - By streamlining the manual administrative process involving distribution, collection, collation and repeated reminders when engaging parents through their children, using hardcopy forms, teachers can better focus on lesson preparation and student engagement.
 
## The App Development Process
- The Parents Gateway app was designed with the citizen's needs in mind.
- It involved collaborating with partners across various division and agencies and gathering feedback from stakeholders and users.
- The app development process adopted a parent-centric design approach and took into consideration familiar user-behaviours (such as adding to calendar, in-app notifications, etc.)
- The Parents Gateway app's implementation adopts a "Forever Beta" approach in order to remain relevant and responsive to necessary changes for continuous improvement.

## Upcoming Features to Expect
- A feature to allow parents to check their child's Edusave account's balance before granting access for activities.
- Online reservation system for more convenient allocation of parent-teacher meetings.
