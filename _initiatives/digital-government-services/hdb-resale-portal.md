**Why use the HDB Resale Portal?**

-   With this portal, flat buyers and sellers need to attend only one appointment with HDB, instead of two previously.
-   As all forms and checks are completed via the online portal, flat buyers and sellers only need to attend a resale completion appointment, either at HDB Hub or at their solicitorâ€™s office, to sign the necessary documents.
-   The streamlined process means the entire transaction can be shortened by up to 8 weeks, when currently it could take about 16 weeks.
