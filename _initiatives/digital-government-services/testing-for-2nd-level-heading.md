From 1 June 2021, TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SE) will be implemented at all venues that experience higher throughput of visitors, and/or where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods. These include shopping malls, workplaces, places of worship, schools and educational institutions. 

 

Importance of TT and SE 

 

2 The TT Programme and SE are important digital tools that enable contact tracers to quickly identify and isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases. This helps to break transmission chains and prevent community outbreaks as more activities resume. While TT data identifies an initial list of close contacts, SE data provides the list of places visited by COVID-19 cases to help our contact tracers establish cluster links. 

 

3 The combined use of these digital tools has enabled us to reduce the average time taken to contact trace from 4 days to less than 1.5 days. More recently, TT has helped to identify 75 persons who had to be placed under quarantine, but would likely not have been picked up through a manual contact tracing process. This has been important in ensuring that the impact of any local cases detected were immediately contained, with very little further spread in the community. With greater active usage of TT, the coverage and speed of contact tracing can be further enhanced. This will be most important in venues or settings where community spread is most likely to occur.
