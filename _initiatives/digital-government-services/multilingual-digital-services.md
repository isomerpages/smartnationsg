The Government is developing a multilingual digital services policy, in line with efforts to promote inclusion and access to digital government services.

To better understand the requirements of users, we are beginning with a selection of digital services that have a high transaction volume, and that are commonly used across demographics.

Since October 2018, citizens have been able to check their Central Provident Fund (CPF) balances, as well as apply for the Housing & Development Board’s (HDB) EASE (Enhancement for Active Seniors) grant, in four languages.

Since December 2018, patients at the National Healthcare Group’s Polyclinics have also been able to make their medical appointments online in the four vernacular languages.
