**What does the Data Innovation Programme Office (DIPO) do?**

-   The DIPO works with industry to scope problem statements through industry-led Data Collaboratives.
-   These provide the entire ecosystem with more flexibility to work with data and share data in exchange for compliance with ex ante standards and transparency, as well as to maintain an open ecosystem that allows dataset to grow.
-   IMDA, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and a Singapore-based startup, DEX have entered into the first Data Collaborative Pilot, which was launched in April 2018. This is a six-month pilot, with the aim of

-   Building a decentralised platform that provide access to data in a regulated and audited fashion, with full awareness and consent of data owners;
-   Driving data sharing collaborative.

-   At the end of six months, it is envisioned that there will be an operational decentralised platform; three collaborative pilots and a Trusted Data framework.
