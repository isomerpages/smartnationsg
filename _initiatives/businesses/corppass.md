**Why use CorpPass**

-   A single authentication and authorisation system for businesses and other entities (such as non-profit organisations and associations) to access e-services provided by government agencies, CorpPass allows access to more than 130 government digital services.
-   CorpPass enhances cyber hygiene by allowing employees to use CorpPass, instead of SingPass, to transact on their companyâ€™s behalf.
-   Business owners are also allowed greater control, with the flexibility of granting employees separate roles to access government digital services.
-   It also allows companies greater convenience and visibility, by providing a single platform to grant and manage the authorisations given to their employees across all government digital services.
-   For foreign registered entities and individuals without SingPass, CorpPass will also allow you to transact with selected government agencies in Singapore.
