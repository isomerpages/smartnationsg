With the upcoming four digital banks, the finance industry's buzz words seem to be all about FinTech. Advancements in financial technology, commonly known as "FinTech", are increasingly challenging how business is being done.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is working towards creating a Smart Financial Centre to ensure we retain our regional financial hub status. The Smart Financial Centre is focused on using technology widely in the financial industry to increase efficiency, create more economic opportunities, and better manage risks. 
 
## MASâ€™ FinTech Initiatives

Efforts are being put in place to nurture a FinTech environment that supports innovation in financial services and where financial institutions such as banks can experiment with the application of new technologies in a safe environment.

### Looking Glass @ MAS
The MAS opened its <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2016/mas-establishes-fintech-innovation-lab" target="_blank">FinTech Innovation Lab</a> as the platform for the FinTech community to connect, collaborate, and co-create with one another. 

### One-stop virtual entity for FinTech matters
To promote Singapore as a FinTech hub, the FinTech Office was established with members of the office coming from MAS, Economic Development Board of Singapore, Infocomm Investments Pte Ltd, Info-communications Media Development Authority, National Research Foundation, and SPRING Singapore.

To encourage and facilitate development of innovative solutions, MAS has published data sets from the MAS' Monthly Statistical Bulletin and other financial statistics as <a href="https://secure.mas.gov.sg/api/Search.aspx" target="_blank">Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) here.</a> 

### "Regulatory Sandbox" Guidelines
-	Taking on a responsive and forward-looking regulatory approach, MAS has provided a conducive environment for FinTech experiments and allow innovations a better chance to take root
-	It released a consultation paper on proposed <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2016/mas-issues-regulatory-sandbox-guidelines-for-fintech-experiments" target="_blank">guidelines for a "regulatory sandbox"</a> that will enable financial institutions and non-financial players to experiment with FinTech solutions.
