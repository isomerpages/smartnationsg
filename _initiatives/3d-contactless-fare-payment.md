# Breezing Through Public Transport 

![contactless payments on public transport](/images/initiatives/contactless-payment-transport.jpg)

With technology such as NFC becoming a big part of our daily lives, more Singaporeans rely on our mobile devices, gadgets and credit/debit cards for our daily transactions. 

Land Transport Authority (LTA) is leveraging these technologies to focus on commuter-centric e-payments for public transport, making fare payments more convenient for commuters.

## SimplyGo - Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) System

In March 2017, LTA and MasterCard launched a pilot programme for commuters to pay for their public transport fares with their contactless credit or debit cards, bypassing the need for an additional EZ-link card in our wallets.  Over 100,000 commuters signed up for the pilot, and there was an average of 60,000 transactions DAILY! 

By 2018, Visa, NETS and mobile payments modes came on board the programme offering even more options for the commuters. Following the successful pilot of the ABT system, SimplyGo was launched on 4 April 2019! 

With SimplyGo, fare payments more convenient for commuters. Commuters can quickly clear the fare gates by scanning their mobile devices or smartwatches that have been linked to their mobile wallets or your contactless bank card to pay for the fare. 

Commuters would no longer have to go to the general ticketing machines if your EZ-link card has a low value â€“ saving us time and hassle!

Commuters can also easily view their travel expenditure and history by registering for an account on the TransitLink SimplyGo Portal, available online and via the TL SimplyGo mobile app.

## Hands-free ticketing technology trials

LTA, SMRT and ST Engineering are running a trial at Redhill, Tiong Bahru, Kembangan and Bedok MRT stations to provide a more inclusive public transport system.

The hands-free automation fare collection system seeks to replace existing card payment methods. It uses long-range Radio Frequency Identification (RFI) technology to detect a commuter's fare card and deduct fares automatically as they pass a sensor. The hands-free fare gates allow people with disabilities or families with young children to quickly enter and exit train stations without the need to tap their fare cards at the gates.

Trials are also underway for a Bluetooth-enabled alternative fare collection system that allows commuters to connect seamlessly with gates using a mobile device.
