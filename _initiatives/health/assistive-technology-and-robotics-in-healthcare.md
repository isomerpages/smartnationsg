# Improving Healthcare With Technology

![robotics in healthcare](/images/initiatives/health-robotics.jpg)
  

**How can technology, healthcare analytics, and robotics improve the provision of healthcare?**

**Enhance overall well-being**

-   Enable independent living for the growing ageing population
-   For the elderly and those with disabilities, developments in assistive technology and robotics can make a real difference to the way they are able to complete tasks and activities  
    

**Enhance productivity in healthcare**

-   Delivery drones dispatch medicines and equipment
-   Industrial robotic arm can pick and pack a range of objects, including fragile items
-   Automated guided vehicles (AGV) can transport food, linen or documents, or move heavy items like beds
-   Data analytics to improve daily operations and reducing waiting times
-   Augmented reality for doctors  
    

**Improve patient care**

-   Robotics technology can improve patient mobility as they rest to avoid bed sores or trips to the toilet
-   Automated bathing machines and autonomous droids that can interact and monitor patient progress
-   Robots that can help recovering stroke patients exercise, or keep early stage dementia patients occupied and alert them to take their medicine  
    

**Example of Assistive Robotics**

RoboCoach Xian

-   A robot trainer that imitates human movements and teaches exercises to senior citizens individually or in groups
-   Enhanced with sensors, it offers personalized gentle exercise routines to help senior citizens - and younger people too - to stay active
-   Uses motion sensing technology to ensure the elderly do their exercise routines correctly
-   Helps to provide physical and cognitive therapy to seniors who have suffered strokes or have disorders such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's
-   Research and development into creating a screen reader could also enhance the learning and communication experiences of the visually impaired.
