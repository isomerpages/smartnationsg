**What is the National Steps Challenge?**

As part of efforts to encourage more Singaporeans to lead active lifestyles, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) started a nation-wide physical activity programme, called the “National Steps Challenge™”, to introduce a fun way to encourage Singaporeans to sit less and move more!

**What does it entail?**

-   Registered participants receive a Steps Tracker
-   Pair the device with the Healthy 365 mobile application, and
-   Start tracking accumulated steps as they walk!
**What are the Benefits?**

-   By using technology as an enabler, the National Steps Challenge empowers Singaporeans to take responsibility for their health and wellbeing by tracking their progress with the aid of a steps tracker and the Healthy 365 mobile application.
-   As participants accumulate steps, not only can they track their diet, they can also see the total calories consumed and expended daily.

**The Results**

-   The initiative was well received. Over 156,000 people, both young and old, participated.
-   Since its launch in November 2015, 70% of previously inactive participants now average more than 7,000 steps per day, with 30% of participants clocking about 10,000 steps a day on average.
-   Based on preliminary findings between November and December 2015, 63% of Challenge participants continued to use it well beyond the formal programme.

**National Steps Challenge Season 3**

The last National Steps Challenge ran from last October to April 2018, and 30,000 out of 696,000 participants managed to clock an average of 5km a day over six months - almost 1,000km in total! The 41,000 people who have taken part in all three editions of the National Steps Challenge also walked more in the third season. Their average daily number of steps went up by 8 per cent to nearly 10,000 steps.
