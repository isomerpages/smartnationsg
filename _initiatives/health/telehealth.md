**Why TeleHealth?**

-   Offers integrated and seamless care to effectively meet our healthcare needs. As therapists will be able to offer care to a larger group of patients, productivity levels are improved.
-   Optimise resources to overcome manpower constraints in the healthcare sector.
-   Improve access to rehabilitation services and achieve higher patient compliance towards better functional recovery.
-   Deliver quality healthcare to an ageing population, enabling our elderly to age-in-place.
-   Reduce need for patients and their caregivers to travel and wait for appointments in hospitals.

**Smart Health Video Consultation (VC) for Healthcare**

-   Launched in April 2017, VC leverages video conferencing technology to allow patients to remotely consult their care team online.
-   The system offers a level of immediacy when patients need care and in-person visits are not possible.
-   The platform will be used in areas such as follow-up services for paediatric eczema pharmacy consultation, paediatric home care services, lactation consultation, and speech therapy for KKH patients; post-stroke, communicable disease, cancer patient care, and more at other institutions.

**Smart Health TeleRehab**

-   Allows patients to undergo their rehabilitation exercises at a time and location of their choice, through the use of wearable sensors and remote monitoring by a therapist.
-   As data is transmitted to therapists wirelessly through wearable motion sensors attached to patientsâ€™ limbs, clinicians can remotely conduct rehabilitation and therapy sessions for patients in the comfort of their homes.
-   Support from healthcare professionals for patients and caregivers can also be done remotely via an Internet-based videoconferencing service that works on consumer devices and can support one-to-one and multi-user interactions.
-   The solution is suitable for patients recovering from conditions including stroke, fractures, lower limb joint replacements or amputations, deconditioning and musculoskeletal conditions.
