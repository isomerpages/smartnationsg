E-Payments are a vital digitalisation area as it provides seamless and secure transactions effortlessly; allowing the Government and Businesses to be more efficient in the digital transaction space. 

Over the last few years, e-payments have become extremely common as the infrastructure strengthens, and more options for end-users have emerged. Creating a simple and secure platform, which operates across various systems, has encouraged the adoption of e-payment and makes it more efficient for businesses and citizens alike. 

## Why E-Payments?
- To provide an open, accessible and interoperable national e-payments infrastructure
- To facilitate simple, swift, seamless, and secure digital transactions
- Enhance convenience and efficiency for citizens and businesses

## Our E-Payments Milestones

- **2017:** PayNow was launched. The platform enables instant peer-to-peer transfers between customers of participating banks simply by entering a mobile or personal identification number.
	- Several Government agencies have begun to use PayNow:
		- CPF and MOE started to pilot the use of PayNow in March 2018 to disburse CPF lump sum and Edusave award monies, respectively.
		- SportSG started to disburse the Singapore National Games Awards to prize winners via PayNow.
		- Since 2019, NSMen will receive IPPT awards via PayNow on the same day, compared to two weeks after their IPPT previously.
		- In 2018, citizens who registered their NRIC on PayNow received their SG Bonus 10 days earlier than those who opted to receive it by direct bank crediting and 20 days earlier than those who opt to receive it by cheque.
- **2018:** PayNow Corporate was introduced to allow businesses and government agencies to pay and receive funds instantaneously using a Unique Entity Number. 
- **2018:** NETS was appointed to develop an interoperable and open access e-payment solution at 200 coffee shops, 25 hawker centres and 20 industrial canteens over two years. This makes it more convenient for citizens and merchants to make and receive payments.
- **2018:** The Singapore government worked with industry players to launch the Singapore Quick Response Code (SGQR) standard, which combines multiple payment QR codes into a single SGQR code. With SGQR, merchants only need one QR code to accept mobile payments.
- **2019:** Non-bank players to get access to FAST
