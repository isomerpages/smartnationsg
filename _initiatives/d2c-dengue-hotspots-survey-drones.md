# Taking The High Road With Dengue

Our climate – warm and humid – supports the breeding of the Aedes mosquito, and we battle with dengue constantly to keep our families and community safe from the virus. NEA puts out regular updates on where the clusters are to posters and banners to remind people to check and remove any possible breeding sites.

## Why is dengue control important in Singapore
- The incidence of dengue has been increasing globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 2.4 million cases in 2010 and 4.2 million in 2019
- As an international transport hub, Singapore remains vulnerable to dengue as we are also in a dengue-endemic region. 
- Our region's constant warm climate and high humidity support the breeding of the Aedes mosquito vector. The warmer weather contributes to the Aedes mosquito vector's faster maturation cycle and faster replication of the Dengue virus.
- Singapore's high human population density also aids the spread of dengue. The Aedes mosquito has adapted particularly well to our urban environment and likes to breed, mate and feed near human dwellings.
 
## NEA uses a variety of efforts in our bid to tackle dengue
- Conducting checks for mosquito breeding habitats based on dengue cases.
- Pre-emptive checks in areas assessed to be at higher risk, even in the absence of dengue cases.
- Working closely with members of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force (IADTF), to ensure that mosquito control programmes are carried out and sustained in respective areas.
- Intensive search-and-destroy operations, both indoors and outdoors, to remove mosquito breeding and applying of larvicides.
- Rallying the community to help sustain efforts for dengue prevention and control. <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/dengue/dengue-community-alert-system" target="_blank">The Dengue Community Alert system</a> helps keep the community up-to-date with the latest dengue situation, via alert banners at strategic locations.
 
### Why the use of drones?
- Roof gutters are potential mosquito breeding habitats due mainly to a lack of maintenance. These are often located at a considerable height, making it difficult to check them using traditional means safely.
- To overcome the limitations faced by officers in inspecting roof gutters, NEA has been deploying drones to monitor roof gutters at selected areas to detect the presence of stagnant water that may lead to mosquito breeding.
- The drone is also equipped to dispense Bti larvicide and eradicate mosquito breeding habitat.
- The drones make the process more efficient and safer for officers.
