# Spearheading Research For Self-Driving Vehicles

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and JTC, in partnership with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), launched The Centre of Excellence for Testing & Research of AVs – NTU (CETRAN), and the Test Circuit, at CleanTech Park on 1 August 2016.

CETRAN will spearhead the development of testing requirements for self-driving vehicles (SDVs) within their 1.8-ha Test Circuit. LTA and JTC jointly developed the Test Circuit to provide industry players with a simulated road environment for the testing SDVs - before their deployment on public roads. 

## Why is CETRAN important to Singapore’s transportation system? 

As we progress in our Smart Nation journey, our transportation system is vital to our transformation. As we explore the new technology for SDVs, we are moving closer to our goal of deploying SDVs. 

With the absence of existing international standards for large-scale SDV deployment, CETRAN will place Singapore at the global forefront to develop such standards to integrate SDVs into our transport system safely!

## What can we expect from CETRAN?

The CETRAN Test Circuit will strengthen Singapore’s attractiveness as a living lab for local and international parties to test, certify, trial and deploy SDVs on our little island. 

NTU will operate the CETRAN Test Circuit and evaluate the SDV prototypes to be tested in Singapore according to their ability to manoeuvre in local conditions such as:
-	Traffic rules
-	Traffic behaviour
-	Road design
-	Our tropical climate

CETRAN houses an expert team formed by NTU, who will perform testing in a computer-simulated environment representative of Singapore’s traffic conditions to complement the tests performed in the Test Circuit.

The CETRAN Test Circuit is open to industry players for developing and testing their SDVs, as they work towards meeting the standards set by CETRAN for Singapore’s transportation system progress.
