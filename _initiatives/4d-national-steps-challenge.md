# A Nation That Works Out Together

![National Steps challenge key visual](/images/initiatives/national-steps-challenge.png)

As part of the efforts to encourage more Singaporeans to lead active lifestyles, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) started a nation-wide physical activity programme, called the “National Steps Challenge™”, in 2015 to introduce a fun way to encourage Singaporeans to sit less and move more!

## How to Participate in the Programme?

-	Participants can redeem a Steps Tracker from HPB; or use your current tracker
-	Pair your device with the Healthy 365 mobile application
-	Start tracking accumulated steps as they walk!

## Benefits of the National Steps Challenge

-	Using technology as an enabler, the National Steps Challenge empowers Singaporeans to take responsibility for their health and wellbeing by tracking their progress with the aid of a steps tracker and the Healthy 365 mobile application.
-	As participants accumulate steps and track their diet, they can see the total calories consumed and expended daily. This Programme gives participants critical insights into their lifestyle and where improvements can be made for a healthy lifestyle!
 
## The Results

- The initiative has been well received over five seasons. The challenge has seen a total of over 1.7 million participants across the five seasons. 
- Since its launch in November 2015, 70% of previously inactive participants now average more than 7,000 steps per day, with 30% of participants clocking about 10,000 steps a day on average.
- Based on preliminary findings between November and December 2015, 63% of Challenge participants continued to use it well beyond the formal Programme.
