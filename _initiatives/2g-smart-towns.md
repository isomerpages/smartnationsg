With 80% of Singapore's population living in public housing – this is a crucial area of development to provide a living environment that we all can enjoy and take pride in. 

In September 2014, HDB introduced the Smart HDB Town Framework that focuses on five key areas to create better living environments for all as we move towards a Smart Nation. 

The frameworks help drive many initiatives such as making digital infrastructure in flats, enabling owners to tap on Smart home applications for their daily living or for Estate managements to collect the data to improve the estate services. 

## What are Smart Towns?

The Smart HDB Town Framework emphases on the following five core areas that HDB introduce into our housing estates:

### Smart Planning

Using computer simulation and data analytics, we can learn how the environment will play into the neighbourhood's design is essential. The Planners will merge the data to help them decide where to put local amenities to keep them shaded or where the greenery should be planted for shade to keep the residents comfortable as we go about our daily tasks. 

### Smart Environment 

Tapping on the network of sensors allows the estate to turn on and off town services such as lights and fans following the weather conditions – rainy or warm and humid days – to help elevate the comfort levels for all while optimising our energy use!

### Smart Estate

Collecting and analysing the estate data provides the Estate Management with valuable information to help them better plan and improve estate services. Finding a change in the data could suggest a potential issue and allowing them to check and fix services (such as lifts) before it becomes an inconvenience to the residents! 

### Smart Living 

With the digital infrastructure in place, homeowners can tap on Smart home solutions to enhance their flats. Punggol Northshore is the first HDB flats to come with the infrastructure to support commercial solutions.

### Smart Community 

To engage the community, one must first understand patterns and preferences. Armed with the anonymised data – from shopping to lifestyle – the community can plan and create bonding activities to bring the residents together. The residents can also use the data to take ownership and co-creating with each other to bring about their dream estate. 

## What is HDB Smart Hub? 

The brains behind the Smart HDB Town Framework is the HDB Smart Hub. As the 'brains' of the estate operations – the HDB Smart Hub collects and integrates the data from various sources. This data repository helps power the framework – from providing insights for town planning and building design to assisting the town councils to improve their estate management.

## Using Tech to Drive Sustainability Efforts

Beyond using technology to improve our estate living, HDB is also tapping on it to become more eco-friendly as we look towards a greener estate. Residents can look forward to sustainable initiatives such as:

### Smart Lighting

Lighting sensors installed in common areas allow HDB to understand traffic patterns to optimise the lighting requirements. Where there is lower or no traffic, lightings can be reduced to help manage energy usage.  

### SolarNova Programme

In 2010, Singapore set a goal to power 60,000 households for a year – which translates to a 350 megawatt-peak (MWp) target - using solar energy by 2020 to tackle climate change. By the first quarter of 2020, we managed to achieve that goal (https://www.ema.gov.sg/media_release.aspx?news_sid=20200422F0KVcWTR1Urf ) 

Our new goal for 2030 is to power 350,000 households for a year (2 gigawatt-peak)! Therefore, this programme focuses on the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Singapore to promote and aggregate demand for solar PV across government agencies to achieve economies of scale and drive the growth of Singapore's solar industry. 

### Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System

This automated waste collection system uses a vacuum-type underground pipe network to collect household waste, and it is transported through underground pipes to a sealed container. 

The benefits of this system include:
-	A reduced need for manual labour
-	Improved living environment as the system will help eliminate foul odours emitted from refuse chutes, thereby promoting a more hygienic and cleaner environment
-	Environmentally friendly as the system reduces the need for washing of chutes, reduces infestation of pests, and minimises decomposition of waste
-	Encourage recycling as it supports the separation of waste for recycling 


## Where are these Smart Towns located?
- HDB's Northshore Residences I & II is the first development to house the first HDB flats equipped with the infrastructure needed to support Smart home solutions.

-	The Punggol town's planners, architects and engineers using smart planning tools and data analytics to analyse the wind flow, solar irradiance (amount of sunlight in a given area) and shaded areas within a town. The information and data will help determine how best to design the new flats to provide maximum thermal comfort and a more conducive living environment for residents.
-	In the private sector, smart home trials have also been launched. Some projects are:
  o	The Luxurie by M1 and Keppel Land 
  o	Visionaire – an Executive Condominium (EC) in Sembawang
  o	iNz Residence, another EC in Choa Chu Kang
