# Efficiency For Business Administration Tasks

Gone are the days when we have to fill up individual sets of forms for each licence that a running a business requires; especially for key information that is normally required for each licence or grant. 

To make government transactions easier for business, the Government consolidated applications for Government grants and licences through the Business Grants Portal and GoBusiness Licensing portal. With a Corppass login, it also automatically pulls your ACRA data into the forms to speed up the time it will take to complete a form. 

## Business Grants Portal

The Business Grants Portal removes the need for businesses to approach different Government agencies separately for grant applications, and avoids the need to repeatedly provide similar information for each grant application.

### Key features

- Simple quiz to help businesses find the right grant
- Apply and manage your grants from the dashboard 

### Visit the <a href="https://www.businessgrants.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Business Grants Portal here.</a>

## GoBusiness Licensing

GoBusiness Licensing provides a one-stop portal for businesses to manage their licences applications easily and efficiently. 

A business can apply, amend, renew or terminate licences from multiple agencies simultaneously, reducing the time and cost for businesses to transact with the Government and they can monitor all their applications from a single dashboard. 

### Key features
- Dashboard view on your on-going applications/licences and payments
- Overview of your licences with other Government agencies
- One-stop communication with licensing officers during application process
