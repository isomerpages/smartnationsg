**Why use the Business Grants Portal & LicenceOne portal?**

-   To make government transactions easier for businesses, the Government started consolidating applications for Government grants and licences through the Business Grants Portal and LicenceOne portal.

-   The Business Grants Portal removes the need for businesses to approach different Government agencies separately for grant applications, and avoids the need to repeatedly provide similar information for each grant application.

[Visit the Business Grants Portal](https://www.businessgrants.gov.sg/) [here](https://www.businessgrants.gov.sg/).

-   LicenceOne Portal allows businesses to apply, amend, renew or terminate licences from multiple agencies easily, reducing the time and cost for businesses to transact with the Government.

[Visit the LicenceOne Portal](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/) [here](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/).
