**What is Smart Urban Mobility?**

Using digital technologies to enhance comfort, convenience and reliability of our public transport systems, and support our vision of a car-lite Singapore.

**What can we expect?**

-   Improved commuting experience: By analysing anonymised data obtained from commuters' fare cards and identifying commuter hotspots to manage bus fleets, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) can help improve commuting experience.

-   Hands-free ticketing technology: A trial was conducted to look at offering a more inclusive public transport system. The hands-free fare gates can allow elderly, families with young children, and commuters with mobility challenges to enter and exit train stations easily, without the need to tap their fare cards at the gates. A hands-free ticketing technology trial on buses will take place later this year.

-   Autonomous shuttles: A number of trials are ongoing to gain insights on how technology can be deployed to strengthen intra-town connectivity, and enhance mobility for commuters, particularly the elderly and persons with disabilities.
