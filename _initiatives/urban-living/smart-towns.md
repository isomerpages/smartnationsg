**What are Smart Towns?**

-   The  **Smart HDB Town Framework**  encapsulates a five-pronged approach HDB is taking to introduce smart into housing estates

	-   Smart Planning - use of computer simulation and data analytics to improve the way towns, precincts, and buildings are planned and designed. Real time information is integrated into the simulation models to derive optimal and cost-effective solutions for urban design technologies in HDB towns.

	-   Smart Environment - linking estates with a network of sensors to capture real-time environment information, such as temperature and humidity, which can be used to create a more pleasant environment for residents.

	-   Smart Estate - leverage smart technologies to collect and analyse estate data to optimise maintenance cycles and pre-empt problems.

	-   Smart Living - digital infrastructure in flats to pave the way for intelligent homes. Residents will be able to tap on smart home applications developed by commercial companies.

	-   Smart Community – leverage data analytics and Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) to better understand and engage residents, enhance community bonding efforts, and empower communities to take greater ownership in co-creating their living environments

-   The  **HDB Smart Hub**  supports the Smart HDB Town Framework. The Smart Hub is akin to the 'brain' for HDB estate operations, collecting and integrating multiple sources of information such as real-time data on energy used by common services in HDB estates. The data repository helps provide insights to facilitate better town planning and building design, and helps town councils improve estate management.
    -   The first phase of the Smart Hub was implemented in Yuhua estate in Jurong East; and the next phase will be at Teck Ghee in Ang Mo Kio (a brownfield site), and at Punggol and Tenggah Town (greenfield sites).

**Sustainability efforts**

Residents can look forward to sustainable initiatives such as:

-   Smart Lighting

	-   Lighting fitted with sensors and anticipatory software, installed in common areas, can help HDB understand human traffic patterns and optimise the provision of lighting.

	-   The lighting in common areas with little or no human traffic detected, could be reduced and help reduce energy usage.

-   SolarNova Programme

	-   The programme looks at accelerating the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Singapore, to promote and aggregate demand for solar PV across government agencies to achieve economies of scale, as well as drive the growth of Singapore’s solar industry.

	-   HDB will progressively roll out 220 MWp of solar panels across 5,500 HDB blocks within the next few years, which will align with Singapore’s plans to generate 350 MWp of solar power by 2020.

-   Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System

	-   An automated waste collection system that uses a vacuum-type underground pipe network to collect household waste, which is then transported through underground pipes to a sealed container. Trucks then periodically collect the waste for disposal.

	-   Benefits include:

		-   Reduced need for manual labour
		-   Improved living environment as the system helps eliminate foul odours emitted from refuse chutes, thereby promoting a more hygienic and cleaner environment
		-   Environmentally friendly as the system reduces the need for washing of chutes, reduces infestation of pests, and minimises decomposition of waste
		-   Encourage recycling as it supports separation of waste for recycling

**Where are these Smart Towns and Homes?**

-   Punggol town:

	-   Town planners, architects and engineers use smart planning tools and data analytics to analyse the wind flow, solar irradiance and shaded areas within a town, and determine how best new flats can be designed and sited to provide maximum thermal comfort and a more conducive living environment for our residents.

-   HDB’s Northshore Residences I & II:

	-   To be completed in 2020, this will house the first HDB flats equipped with the infrastructure needed to support such smart home solutions.

	-   A number of private sector-driven smart home trials have also been launched, such as The Luxurie by M1 and Keppel Land which was announced in December 2015. Visionaire and iNz Residence, Executive Condominium (EC) projects with Smart Homes at Sembawang and Choa Chu Kang respectively, are also available for sale.
