**What is the Smart Elderly Alert System?**

-   Sensors placed in the flat to help monitor the movements of the elderly, and caregivers will be alerted should irregular movements be detected (e.g. if no movements are detected for a period of time).
-   In April 2016, residents from some 3,200 households in Yuhua estate were eligible to participate in a trial to use smart devices in their homes. This followed an initial trial of 10 households in Yuhua which yielded positive responses on the ease of use and non-intrusive nature of the devices; and a trial conducted in 2015 in 12 households in Woodlands, Yishun, Clementi and Marine Parade.


**What are the benefits?**

-   Non-intrusive, non-contact and low cost methodology, and provides timely alerts.

-   Allows the elderly to live independently, and offers peace of mind to family members and caregivers.

**A number of commercial providers currently offer the solution. This includes:**
