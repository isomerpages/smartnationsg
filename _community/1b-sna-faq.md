### **Q3. What opportunities are open to me as a Smart Nation Ambassador?**

- SCOPE (Smart Nation Co-creating with Our People Everywhere) is a co-creation platform spearheaded by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group that facilitates testing of digital government initiatives in development and feedback gathering from citizens. These insights help us to enhance our digital government services to be more accessible and convenient for all. Smart Nation Ambassadors will join us in engaging citizens during such events.

- Provide one-on-one assistance at Digital Clinics run by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), and help participants, especially seniors, become more proficient with their mobile devices., This includes teaching them how to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots, personalise accessibility tools on their devices, and adjust phone settings and functions (e.g. text size, magnifier function, voice-to-text function, using cloud settings) to best suit their needs.

These are just some of the opportunities that you will be able to participate in. If you have ideas on how you can help others to live, work and play in a Smart Nation, drop us an [email](mailto:ambassadors@smartnation.gov.sg) and let us know!
