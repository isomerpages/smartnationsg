### **Q3. What opportunities are open to me as a Smart Nation Ambassador?**

- SNAs co-create digital government services with the community through various platforms such as [Smart Nation Co-creating with Our People Everywhere (SCOPE)](/community/scope) and Smart Nation builder. Co-creation involves understanding the community’s pain points and problem statements so that digital solutions can be built to directly meet their needs. SCOPE is a co-creation platform spearheaded by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group. It facilitates the testing of new digital government initiatives in development and feedback gathering from citizens. These insights help us to enhance our digital government services to be more accessible and convenient for all.  

- SNAs provide guidance on the use of digital government solutions. These include demonstrating government apps and even the use of sensor technology! For example, the volunteers were at the Merdeka Generation Roadshows and Skillsfuture Festival to share with the public the benefits of apps like MyTransport.SG and Singpass Mobile, as well as demonstrate how to download and use them on their smartphones.

- SNAs lead and guide groups at events. At larger events such as Digital Inclusion Festival and Smart Nation & U, where they act as event guides. They bring the interested public around on tours to event highlights and help bring to life the various showcases on display!

- SNAs can teach others about technology. With #Smart NationTogether, SNAs have curated an extensive list of live online programmes such as hands-on workshops to learn data analytics tools, lessons on using Zoom and Singpass Mobile and even coding and STEM classes for families with young children.

- SNAs can set up booths at Smart Nation events to provide hands-on experiences to the public! If you are a tech company or entrepreneur with an interesting solution or have an idea to showcase, we welcome you to do so at the events!  

These are just some of the opportunities that you will be able to participate in. If you have ideas on how you can help others to live, work and play in a Smart Nation, [email us](mailto:ambassadors@smartnation.gov.sg) and let us know!
