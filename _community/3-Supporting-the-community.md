As Singapore transforms into a Smart Nation, we want to also ensure that all segments of our society can be a part of this journey. Below are various Government initiatives created to assist different groups of people. 

## Home Access 
Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)'s [Home Access programme](https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/home-access) provides eligible households with 2 years of subsidised fibre broadband connectivity from as low as $6 per month, with an option to bundle it with a tablet or smartphone.

## Peopleâ€™s Association (PA) Seniors for Smart Nation
PA Senior Academy's (SA) key mission is to encourage seniors aged 50 years and above, to pursue lifelong learning aspirations and lead an active lifestyle, by providing accessible and affordable senior-friendly courses. 

As part of the programme, there is a range of popular IT-related courses (conducted in English and Mandarin) to prepare seniors to be Smart Nation ready. At the same time, they enhance their quality of life and integrate seamlessly into the community.
