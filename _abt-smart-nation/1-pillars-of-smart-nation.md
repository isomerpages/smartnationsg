# The Foundations Of Our Journey

With every project, we start by ensuring the key components are adequately addressed and planned and detailed out to enable everyone involved in the project to all be on the same page, to move towards the same goal. With a project such as Smart Nation – our people, our companies and our public agencies all have a role to play in this transformation – it is critical to ensure that we lay out our foundations well. 

For the Smart Nation Initiative, our key pillars that support Singapore’s Smart Nation goals are:
-	Digital Economy
-	Digital Government 
-	Digital Society
 
## Digital Economy
Rapid digitalisation has been disrupting business operations, altering industry structures and redefining rules globally. We need to be able to adapt and embrace digitalisation since the world constantly changing.

Talent and businesses are critical in a digital economy that will continue to keep Singapore vibrant and competitive. We are digitalising our economy from a position of strength. Singapore’s pro-business environment, excellent infrastructure and connectivity to major Asian economies, and availability of investment and well-developed technology will continue to help attract businesses and talents.

Our vision is to build a vibrant economy that remains attractive to foreign investments, with good opportunities for Singaporeans. We want to digitalise industries to increase business efficacy and create new jobs and opportunities.

The <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/infocomm-media-landscape/SGDigital/Digital-Economy-Framework-for-Action" target="_blank">Digital Economy Framework for Action</a> sets out a guide to help our businesses and workforce prepare for and embrace the possibilities in a digital economy.

## Digital Government

The Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) was launched on 5 Jun 2018, stating the vision and strategies for achieving a Digital Government. 14 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were set to measure the progress of our digitalisation.

Two years after the launch of the DGB, the Government has introduced new policies and initiatives. COVID-19 has also reaffirmed our emphasis on capability building and compelled different parts of the Government to accelerate the use of data and technology to offer digital services that minimise physical contact and use technology and digital tools to keep us safe.

The DGB has been updated to accurately reflect the current plans and to push for more ambitious goals to pursue deeper and more extensive digitalisation within the Government. New examples are included to better explain the latest efforts and benefits of Digital Government. The refresh is in line with the approach to improve the blueprint iteratively.

The key changes made to the DGB include:
1.	**Elaboration on the DGB vision** of “Digital to the core” and “Serves with heart”. A “digital to the core” framework has been developed to describe how the Government is developing and measuring itself towards this vision. There is a greater emphasis on “Serves with heart” to explain how the use of digital technologies is to help the Government achieve its main purpose of serving citizens better and building trust.
2.	**Updated DGB strategies** that stresses greater importance on user centricity and co-creation, improving how we work as digital organisations and harnessing new technology including Artificial Intelligence.
3.	**New and updated KPIs.**
  - *New KPI:* at least 70% of eligible Government systems to be on commercial cloud by 2023
  - *Update existing KPI:* Time required to fuse and share core data for cross-agency projects to be no more than 7 working days
4.	**The future direction for Digital Government, as at 2020 and in light of COVID-19.** A new section has been added to signal the future direction and the steps that agencies need to undertake to progress towards being digital organisations, which requires deeper changes in organisational policy, structure, and culture.

**Key Highlights of the Progress of DGB KPIs as of end-2019**
1.	86% of citizens and 77% of businesses reported that they are “very” or “extremely” satisfied (at least 5 on a 6-point scale) with Government digital services, against the DGB target of 75-80%. These are the best results since the survey started in 2012. Both results also improved significantly, by 8%, compared to 2018.
2.	To date, 95% of transactions (by volume) are completed digitally from end-to-end, meeting the target of 90-95%.
3.	We have met the target for number of officers trained in data analytics and data science and will review a new KPI.
4.	All 20 Ministries have submitted plans to use Artificial Intelligence.  

## Digital Society

We need to ensure that all Singaporeans have access to technology to enhance our everyday lives and equip people with the skills and know-how to use technology safely and confidently.

To empower Singaporeans to maximise the opportunities of a digital society, improve their lives, be connected to the world, and have an equal chance to succeed, we released the Digital Readiness Blueprint.

The blueprint signifies the commitment of the Singapore Government and our partners in the private and people sectors to ensure that people are at the centre of Singapore’s Smart Nation efforts and that everyone can experience the benefits of technology.
