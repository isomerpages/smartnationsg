SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) Boxes are being progressively rolled out at public transport nodes for commuters to check in and check out. This provides commuters with another option to check in/check out with their TraceTogether App/Token, on top of existing SafeEntry QR codes, to support contact tracing efforts. Token users may also use the SEGW Box to check and ensure they have a working Token. 

The SEGW Boxes have been installed at the following venues, located near the Passenger Service counters:

* Woodlands Integrated Transport Hub
* Jurong East Bus Interchange 
* Punggol Bus Interchange 
* Serangoon Bus Interchange
* Serangoon MRT Station (NEL)  
* Chinatown MRT Station (NEL)  
* Bishan MRT Station (CCL)  
* Woodlands MRT Station (TEL)
* Choa Chu Kang MRT Station (NSL)  
* Newton MRT Station (NSL)  
* Newton MRT Station (DTL)
* Promenade MRT Station (CCL) 
* Clementi MRT Station (EWL)  

More SEGW Boxes will be set up in the following months.
