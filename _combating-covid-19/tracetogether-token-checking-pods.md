Have you checked if your TraceTogether Token is working? The next time you are at an MRT station, look out for our Token checking pods at the platform or near the gantries for a quick check!

## What Are Token Checking Pods?

These Token checking pods are equipped with a SafeEntry Gateway device for you to check if your Token is working.

If your Token is working, there will be a green light and a beep sound when the Token is brought near the SafeEntry Gateway device.

If your Token is faulty or is out of battery, there will be no light and no beep.

You can also find the nearest Token replacement booth or CC for you to get a free replacement Token. You may also consider returning your old Token at these booths, if you are already using the TraceTogether App!
